/*
Here are browsers that do not support Java Applet any more:

Google Chrome
Firefox
Safari
Microsoft Edge
Opera
So, as you can see that all these browsers not longer support Applet. Even the newer versions of Oracleâ€™s JDK does not come with the support of the Java browser plugin.

The reason for dropping the support was because of security issues and risks that were found.
